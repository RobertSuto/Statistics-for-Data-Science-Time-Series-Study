The durbin_levinson function implements the Durbin-Levinson algorithm to compute the coefficients of an autoregressive model of order p for a given time series. The function takes as input a time series series and an integer p representing the order of the autoregressive model. The function returns a matrix phi_matrix containing the coefficients of the autoregressive model.

The function first calls the compute_sample_autocovariance function to compute the sample autocovariances of the input time series up to a maximum lag of p+1. The compute_sample_autocovariance function takes as input a time series series and an integer lag_max representing the maximum lag for which to compute the autocovariances. The function returns a list autocovariances containing the computed autocovariances.

The durbin_levinson function then initializes two arrays: phi_matrix, a matrix of zeros with shape (p, p), and var_list, an array of zeros with length p. The first element of phi_matrix is set to the ratio of the second element of samples to the first element of samples, and the first element of var_list is set to the product of the first element of samples and (1 - phi_matrix[0, 0]**2).

The function then enters a for loop that iterates over the range from 1 to p. In each iteration, a temporary variable temp is calculated as the difference between the (i+1)-th element of samples and the sum of the products of elements in the (i-1)-th row of phi_matrix and elements in samples with indices from i to 1 in reverse order. The (i,i)-th element of phi_matrix is then set to the ratio of temp to the (i-1)-th element of var_list.

The function then enters another for loop that iterates over the range from 0 to i. In each iteration, the (i,j)-th element of phi_matrix is set to the difference between the (i-1,j)-th element of phi_matrix and the product of the (i,i)-th element of phi_matrix and the (i-1,i-j-1)-th element of phi_matrix.

After exiting the inner for loop, the (i)-th element of var_list is set to the product of the (i-1)-th element of var_list and (1 - phi_matrix[i, i]**2). After exiting both for loops, the function returns the matrix phi_matrix.

In summary, this code computes an autoregressive model for a given time series using Durbin-Levinson algorithm. It does so by computing sample autocovariances and using them to iteratively calculate coefficients for an autoregressive model.
